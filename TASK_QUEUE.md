## TASK-20260417-FORGE-INFRA-001 - Wire cost tracking into poll script
- **Assignee:** Forge
- **Status:** PENDING
- **Priority:** Medium
- **From:** Triton
- **Client:** internal
- **Task:** Update Forge's task poll script to log token usage after each task execution using log-cost.js from mission-control.

### Instructions
1. Pull latest mission-control — `log-cost.js` is now in the repo root
2. Update the Forge poll script (wherever it lives on RICHARD-WS) to:
   - Instruct Claude at end of each task to output: `TOKENS: input=NNNN output=NNNN`
   - Parse that line from the output
   - Call `node ~/mission-control/log-cost.js --task TASK-ID --model sonnet --input N --output N --agent Forge --client CLIENT`
3. Test by running a dummy task and verifying an entry appears in `mission-control/cost-log.json`
4. Commit cost-log.json (gitignore-exempt) and push

See Nautilus's `/home/richard/poll-tasks.sh` on 192.168.1.184 as reference implementation.

## TASK-20260416-FORGE-PNT-001
- **Assignee:** Forge
- **Status:** DONE
- **Priority:** High
- **From:** Sonnet (Richard)
- **Client:** PNT
- **Task:** Rebuild PNT_Sprint4_Delivery_Report.docx — match S3 format exactly
- **Completed:** 2026-04-16
- **Result:** Rebuilt from scratch using python-docx. US Letter, 1" margins, running header with PNT green (#1E3D2F) bottom border, green project info table, all 8 screenshots embedded, page breaks between sections, cumulative sprint table with COMPLETE row shading. Committed ca42ba9 → merged to main 4f29f62.

### Context
The current S4 report does not match the S3 format. Rebuild it from scratch using docx-js following the SKILL.md at /mnt/skills/public/docx/SKILL.md.

The S3 report (reference: docs/PNT_Sprint3_Delivery_Report.docx) has this exact structure:

**Page layout:** US Letter (12240 x 15840 DXA), 1 inch margins

**Header (every page):** Two-column using tab stop — left: "PNT Central Brain | Sprint 4 Delivery Report" | right: "1AltX LLC | April 2026" — separated by a bottom border line in PNT green (#1E3D2F)

**Page 1:**
- Bold large text: "SPRINT 4 DELIVERY REPORT"
- Subtitle: "Financial Layer"
- Project info table (2 columns, no visible borders, green header shading #1E3D2F with white text):
  | Project | PNT Central Brain — AtlasPerk SL / Portugal Nature Trails |
  | Contractor | 1AltX LLC — Richard Mabbun |
  | Sprint | Sprint 4 of 6 |
  | Completed | April 25, 2026 |
  | Invoice | $2,550.00 USD |
  | Commit | d4811cb — merged to main |
- Page break

**Executive Summary** (Heading 1 in PNT green)
Sprint 4 delivered the complete financial layer of the PNT Central Brain — pricing schema, invoicing, payments, expenses, guide payroll, and a live financial portal. This sprint introduced full cost and revenue tracking per booking with real-time margin calculations, on-demand invoice PDF generation (CN Proforma + PNT Balance), and four financial reporting views in the portal. All deliverables have been tested against live booking data and are live on the production system.

## TASK-20260417-FORGE-DAX-001 - OpenID email case-sensitivity fix
- **Assignee:** Forge
- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-04-17
- **Title:** Patch LibreChat OpenID strategy to normalize email to lowercase

### Completed
Entra was returning mixed-case emails (Brett@impact-cp.com, Jonathan@impact-cp.com) causing "user not found" warnings on every SSO login. Fixed by patching `openidStrategy.js` to lowercase the email at extraction time.

- `patches/patch-openid-lowercase.js` added to DAX repo
- `Dockerfile` updated with new patch step
- Committed b1f85f3 + ad763d3 → scubarichard/dax master
- **Dakona pilot** — built `v0.5.3-hotfix1` → `acrdaxdakona`, deployed to `ca-dax-dakona-pilot` revision `--0000090` ✅
- **ICP** — built `v0.6.2-hotfix1` → `acrdaximpactcapital` (ACR run ca3), deployed to `ca-dax-impact-capital` revision `--0000021` ✅
- Root cause during deploy: `acrdaxdakona` (Dakona tenant) can't be pulled from ICP tenant via managed identity — cross-tenant ACR auth fails. Resolved by building to ICP's own ACR and removing the cross-tenant registry entry.

**[Forge] 2026-04-17:** DONE — both containers live with email patch.
