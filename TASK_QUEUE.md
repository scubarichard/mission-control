- **Assignee:** Forge
- **Status:** PENDING
- **Priority:** High
- **From:** Sonnet (Richard)
- **Client:** PNT
- **Task:** Rebuild PNT_Sprint4_Delivery_Report.docx — match S3 format exactly

### Context
The current S4 report does not match the S3 format. Rebuild it from scratch using docx-js following the SKILL.md at /mnt/skills/public/docx/SKILL.md.

The S3 report (reference: docs/PNT_Sprint3_Delivery_Report.docx) has this exact structure:

**Page layout:** US Letter (12240 x 15840 DXA), 1 inch margins

**Header (every page):** Two-column using tab stop — left: "PNT Central Brain | Sprint 4 Delivery Report" | right: "1AltX LLC | April 2026" — separated by a bottom border line in PNT green (#1E3D2F)

**Page 1:**
- Bold large text: "SPRINT 4 DELIVERY REPORT"
- Subtitle: "Financial Layer"
- Project info table (2 columns, no visible borders, green header shading #1E3D2F with white text):
  | Project | PNT Central Brain — AtlasPerk SL / Portugal Nature Trails |
  | Contractor | 1AltX LLC — Richard Mabbun |
  | Sprint | Sprint 4 of 6 |
  | Completed | April 25, 2026 |
  | Invoice | $2,550.00 USD |
  | Commit | d4811cb — merged to main |

**Executive Summary** (Heading 1 in PNT green)
Sprint 4 delivered the complete financial layer of the PNT Central Brain — pricing schema, invoicing, payments, expenses, guide payroll, and a live financial portal. This sprint introduced full cost and revenue tracking per booking with real-time margin calculations, on-demand invoice PDF generation (CN Proforma + PNT Balance), and four financial reporting views in the portal. All deliverables have been tested against live booking data and are live on the production system.
